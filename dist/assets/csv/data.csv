The People For Bernie Sanders 2016,1645816202305250,Political Organization,"We are activists and organizers building a broad, effective movement for democratic change. We come from different backgrounds, and were inspired by different issues and fights for peace, rights and the planet. Our goal is a government that carries out the will of the people, and does not serve to increase the profits of the 1% at the expense of the rest of us. To that end, we support Bernie Sanders in his bid to become the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. We stand firmly behind Senator Sanders as the strongest progressive possibility in the race right now. His commitment to our values is one of long standing commitment. Sanders is the bold alternative. As a truly progressive candidate for the Democratic Party nomination, Senator Sanders has the chance to inspire millions of Americans with policy proposals that put the interests of the 99%, front and center. Franklin D. Roosevelt called out the “economic royalists” of his day. Senator Sanders is picking up the banner. He answers to “We the People” and not to the corporate and financial sectors. Bernie brings the kind of leadership that is necessary to building a real, living democracy. The initiators of this letter are veteran grassroots organizers of Occupy Wall Street, and are joined by many energized brothers and sisters we have met along the way. In September 2011, our efforts changed the narrative of American politics, helping to focus it on the issues of our time: inequality, surrender to the power of concentrated wealth, the corruption of our democracy by moneyed interests, and the need for solutions as radical as our problems. We are signing as individuals hoping to kickstart a small ‘d’ democratic movement. People For Bernie won’t be a corporate-style, staff-driven, controlled-message, top-down enterprise. It will reflect diverse constituencies from a broad range of movements, which in many cases haven’t seen the Democratic Party as a home for their deepest aspirations. It will reflect our commitment to fundamental change, not just a change of faces at the top of the political pyramid. People for Bernie it will reflect the urgency of more and fiercer grassroots political activity at the base. We call on all other progressive forces to unite behind Sanders so we can have a united front in this important campaign.  We are activists and organizers building a broad, effective movement for democratic change. Send money to Bernie, not us. Internet Mom of #FeelTheBern",189277
Occupy Wall Street,153774071379194,Cause,"This page is not affiliated with any General Assembly or political group. It is not associated with the main FB Occupy Wall St. account, which is funded in part by the People For Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party -- the antithesis of what Occupy Wall Street was all about when it was established by anarchists and based on anarchist principles. This page was turned over to an anarchist collective on September 19, 2015. Its admins are not paid by political parties or Super PACs to further political careers, nor do they assist, communicate with, or approve of Occupy pages or organizers who have thrown the Occupy name under the bus in favor of a little cash and another Democrat in the White House. The #FeelTheBullshit hashtag represents an ongoing campaign against those in the former Occupy movement who have blatantly undermined founding principles of transparency and non-political association with the Wall Street parties -- the Democrats representing the ""left wing"" (as opposed to Republicans right-wing) affiliation with Wall St. banks, corporations aplenty, and military contractors. What this means is that this page will continue to curate Occupy-esque content -- without all the #Feelthebern sell-out nonsense attached.

Seriously, has anyone voted more on the correct side of the major issues of our time? Senator Sanders introduced a bill to prohibit offshore drilling in 2010. He has been vocal in his opposition to Citizens United and McCutcheon. He is for states requiring labeling regarding GMO's, and voted to expand Social Security benefits. He wants to stop fracking, is a friend to Labor and for $15, and importantly against TPP. He's voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, ending Glass Steagall, the Iraq War, the Bank Bailout and Keystone XL. We've had corporate presidents for over thirty years. Bill Clinton, ended Glass Steagall, signed NAFTA into law, Obama, wants to fast track TPP free trade agreement, over the objections of most Democrats in congress. Senator Sanders is the hardest working Senator in the Senate, his reward, more knowledge than most. His record shows he is for the middle class. It is critical we have a people's president, with 33% of jobs now done by Americans being done by technology in ten short years, hardest hit, white collar positions. Add to that that number the jobs lost from TPP and the line of free trade agreements waiting in line to be passed or still being negotiated, we could see unemployment of over 30%. During the height of the Great Depression unemployment, 28-29%. Help us gain momentum in the first caucus/primary state, you don't have to live in Iowa.

After graduation from the University of Chicago in 1964, he moved to Vermont. Early in his career, Sanders was director of the American People’s Historical Society. Elected Mayor of Burlington by 10 votes in 1981, he served four terms. Before his 1990 election as Vermont's at-large member in Congress, Sanders lectured at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and at Hamilton College in upstate New York. The Almanac of American Politics has called Sanders a ""practical"" and ""successful legislator."" He has focused on the shrinking middle class and widening income gap in America that is greater than at any time since the Great Depression. Other priorities include reversing global warming, universal health care, fair trade policies, supporting veterans and preserving family farms.

Political Nation,311557105709255,Political Organization,"An organization dedicated to Democracy by the people, for the people. Our Congress (the majority of them GOP) should be tried for treason against the American people, for NOT doing their jobs and not acting in the Best interest of the American people. This has been the worst congress in this nation’s history with a 0% approval rating. Filibuster everything, blocking bills on purpose, making the US citizens suffer and pay the bills that they themselves had created. Not too long back, the GOP was bent out of shape to impeach a president for getting a blowjob and lying about it. Seriously? These individuals not only should be impeached but charged with treason, and stripped of their pensions and held accountable for the acts against the American people. They need to be treated as equally as Bernie Madoof, with their families stripped of their wealth off the American people. Sorry Congress! No free rides! Your being a Senator or Congressman is not an entitlement. You were voted in to serve us the American people, not the lobbyist that pay you and keeps you in their back pockets like the NRA and 1000’s of others. Are you the American taxpayer tired of their crap? So, am I! Congressional Reform Act of 2012 1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they're out of office. 2. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. It may not be used for any other purpose. 3. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do. 4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people. 7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void effective 12/1/12. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work. If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S.) to receive the message. Don't you think it's time?  A simple goal - to report about our elected officials that are preventing the United States & the American people on moving forward, with equality! ",9520

Oregon For Bernie Sanders 2016,488929357930106,Community,"We all know our country is in deep trouble. Many of us feel disillusioned with our government’s inability to address our nation's problems in a meaningful way. But this time we don’t have to choose between the same old corporate politicians. We don't have to throw our hands up in surrender to the pointlessness of politics. We have Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate for President of the United States of America. Bernie comes with a record of proven leadership. Since 1981 he has served as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, congressman in the US House of Representatives, and is currently Vermont’s junior Senator. Throughout his career he has proven an unwavering commitment to the idea that the average American deserves a basic right to healthcare, opportunity, equality and a clean environment. His commitment to these ideals has been backed-up by solid ideas and a knack for creative problem solving that has often put him at odds with the Big Money that dominates politics. At the root of his concerns is the ever-widening income gap in our nation, the undo influence of the very wealthy, and the negative effects this has on the average citizen’s quality of life. In his own words: “We live in the one of the wealthiest countries on earth, yet children go hungry, veterans sleep out on the streets and senior citizens cannot afford their prescription drugs. This is what a rigged economic system looks like.” 63% of Americans agree with him. Bernie is a sincere champion of the people. And unlike other candidates for President, he has done more than give abstract lip service to the problems facing our nation. He has a plan. -Break up the banks. If they are too big to fail, they are too big to exist. -Increase oversight of Wall Street. Our social safety net should never be threatened by white collar crime, as it was in 2008. -Build the Middle Class with a Federal Jobs program that would fix our ailing infrastructure. -Fight free trade agreements that create poverty and encourage terrible working conditions and low wages for the benefit of large corporations. -Demilitarize the police. There is no reason they should have tanks. This is antagonistic. -Get Big Money out of politics. Bernie has a plan to overturn Citizen’s United. -Raise the Minimum Wage to a Living Wage. -Cut Greenhouse Gases in a meaningful way. Bernie is one of the leading voices on this issue. Stricter environmental standards. The future health of our air, soil and water is not a commodity. -Free college tuition at public universities. This has been done successfully in several European countries and Bernie wants to follow their example. -Maintain and increase health care coverage so that no citizen remains excluded. -Pay for these changes with reasonable taxes on Wall Street speculation, closing corporate loopholes, and an increasing the income tax burden on the very wealthy. These are just some of the issues that Bernie is committed to tackling. They are right in line with the opinions of the majority of the American people, often regardless of party membership. Unlike his opponents, Bernie Sanders is a leader who has identified the real issues facing our nation, and he has a meaningful plan to address them. Bernie gives you a voice in your America. Give him your vote. If you want to help Oregon #FeelTheBern like and share this page. It's time we start talking about what's really important. Bernie Sanders does! ",8427

Seriously, has anyone voted more on the correct side of the major issues of our time? Senator Sanders introduced a bill to prohibit offshore drilling in 2010. He has been vocal in his opposition to Citizens United and McCutcheon. He is for states requiring labeling regarding GMO's, voted to expand Social Security benefits and introduced a bill to break up the BIG BANKS. He wants to stop fracking, is a friend to Labor and for $15, and importantly against TPP. He's voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, ending Glass Steagall, the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, the Bank Bailout and Keystone XL. We've had corporate presidents for over thirty years. Bill Clinton, ended Glass Steagall, signed NAFTA into law, Obama, wants to fast track TPP free trade agreement, over the objections of most Democrats in congress. Senator Sanders is the hardest working Senator in the Senate, his reward, more knowledge than most. His record shows he is for the middle class. It is critical we have a people's president, with 33% of jobs now done by Americans being done by technology in ten short years, hardest hit, white collar positions. Add to that that number the jobs lost from TPP and the line of free trade agreements waiting in line to be passed or still being negotiated, we could see unemployment of over 30%.

Add your name to support my campaign. For many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across our country, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good, hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeply concerned about the future of our country. They wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity and security. The challenges facing our country are enormous. It's not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been disappearing. It's that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at any time since the late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being squeezed and left behind. The disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case and in other related decisions are undermining the very foundations of American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super PACs to buy politicians and elections. And the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is the central challenge of our times and our planet. The middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last another generation if we don’t boldly change course now. After a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. But let's be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It's about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: ""Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires."" Our movement needs people like you involved to help it succeed. Add your name now to say you support my campaign for president. I run not to oppose any man or woman, but to propose new and far-reaching policies to deal with the crises of our times. And I run because I know we must change course now, or risk losing the future for so many to the interests of so few. A successful national campaign is a massive undertaking, especially when we will be heavily outspent. It will require the active participation of millions of Americans in every community in our country. In fact, it will require nothing less than a political revolution which combats the demoralization and alienation of so many of our people from the political process. Let me be very honest. It may be too late to stop the billionaire class from trying to buy the Presidency and Congress. The forces of greed already may be too powerful. But we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try. We owe it to them to make the fight and, through the power of our numbers, turn back this assault on the foundation of our democracy and our future. We are at a moment of truth. We need to face up to the reality of where we are as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for change. I believe America is ready for a new path to the future. On May 26th I will formally launch our campaign at the City Hall in Burlington, Vermont, where I served as Mayor. I ask you to join with me in our campaign for President of the United States. Sincerely, Senator Bernie Sanders A political revolution is coming. Are you ready for Bernie? We are Montanans working together in our communities to support Bernie Sanders for President.",7133

This is why we need Bernie Sanders for President in 2016.

New Hampshire Grassroots for Bernie Sanders,1519480914961160,Community,"Bernie Sanders is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. His previous 16 years in the House of Representatives make him the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history. Born in 1941 in Brooklyn, Sanders attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College and the University of Chicago. After graduating in 1964, he moved to Vermont. In 1981, he was elected (by 10 votes) to the first of four terms as mayor of Burlington. Sanders lectured at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and at Hamilton College in upstate New York before his 1990 election as Vermont's at-large member in Congress. The Almanac of American Politics calls Sanders a practical and successful legislator."" Throughout his career he has focused on the shrinking American middle class and the growing income and wealth gaps in the United States. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Sanders in 2014 passed legislation reforming the VA health care system. Congressional Quarterly said he was able “to bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” Today, Sanders remains on the veterans committee and was tapped by Senate leadership to be the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. He also serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he has focused on global warming and rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. He is a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where he has championed efforts to transform our energy system from fossil fuels to renewable power sources like solar and wind. He also sits on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where he has fought for greater access to affordable health care and improved education programs from pre-K to college"" From: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/about ***Not Official Campaign Page*** Grassroots page to elect Bernie Sanders as the Next President.

Seriously, has anyone voted more on the correct side of the major issues of our time? Senator Sanders introduced a bill to prohibit offshore drilling in 2010. He has been vocal in his opposition to Citizens United and McCutcheon. He is for states requiring labeling regarding GMO's, and voted to expand Social Security benefits. He wants to stop fracking, is a friend to Labor and for $15, and importantly against TPP. He's voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, ending Glass Steagall, the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, the Bank Bailout and Keystone XL. We've had corporate presidents for over thirty years. Bill Clinton, ended Glass Steagall, signed NAFTA into law, Obama, wants to fast track TPP free trade agreement, over the objections of most Democrats in congress. Senator Sanders is the hardest working Senator in the Senate, his reward, more knowledge than most. His record shows he is for the middle class. It is critical we have a people's president, with 33% of jobs now done by Americans being done by technology in ten short years, hardest hit, white collar positions. Add to that that number the jobs lost from TPP and the line of free trade agreements waiting in line to be passed or still being negotiated, we could see unemployment of over 30%. During the height of the Great Depression unemployment, 28-29%.  We believe it's again time for a president who governs for the middle class and small businesses.",6003

I ask that you take a moment to realize why moderation might be necessary in a group of 3000+ people to remain productive and peaceful. Some seem obvious to most of us... 1. Name calling/personal attacks. Please, people. If you are truly attempting to make a valid point you are expected to conduct yourself in a reasonable manner. You know what is right and what is wrong, I'm certain of this. No one reserves the right to be rude. 2. Multiple posts. Please, don't hijack multiple threads with posts which aren't applicable to that thread. Your posts are visible in the ""published"" area for people to see. 3. Trolling. Trolls, I understand you're here because you don't like Bernie Sanders. That's fine. Make your points, be respectful. Pestering the group will get you booted. 4. Rabbit holing/high maintenance. You have made your point and have engaged others in debate. Not everyone is agreeing with you. That's OK. Know when to stop. Agree to disagree, sometimes. If you spend several DAYS repeating the same points and there's no sign of stopping, even after I've politely asked you to LET IT GO for the sake of a peaceful resolution, I have to cut you loose. 5. Angry essays. You have an opinion about my censoring you? Or BLM? Or Bernie's stance on taxing the rich? That's cool. I'll accept the criticism and I'll do so gracefully. 1500+ words with spitting anger and personal attacks will get you deleted and banned. See ""high maintenance"".

Even if you haven't 100% committed to writing in Bernie's name, should it come to that, and are still questing for information in order to make an informed decision, we are happy to have you here! :-) This Page was created in the interest of bringing together people who are seeing that without Bernie, there really are no good options. What difference does it make to vote for any Democrat under any circumstances just to avoid Republicans, when in fact the only option, Hillary, is pro-Monsanto, pro-TPP, pro-fracking, pro-big banks, when her two biggest donors are Citigroup and Goldman Sachs? Clearly, she has sold out to the billionaires as much as any Republican has. And what is the point of voting Republican out of religious beliefs? Be religious, be virtuous ~ we get that. But keep in mind that the Republican candidates are saying what you want to hear and then will make you a serf for their corporate dictators  that's all they're really interested in. This is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike are running to Bernie as fast as they can. By showing solidarity in numbers, we will send a strong message to the DNC (Democratic National Committee) that we will NOT back and feel forced to vote for Hillary, THEY will be forced to think twice. Moreover, now that more and more people are realizing that ""any Democrat"" is no solution, those who love Bernie but are afraid to vote for him will have reason to believe that their vote for him WILL count. We need those people! This Page is for them, AND the DNC. ",3241

Bern Machine,632669556876167,Community,"I created the Bern Machine to raise awareness of Bernie Sanders because I believe he is the only candidate for President of the United States that is fighting for us, we the people of the United States of America. I believe all the other candidates are captured by corporate interests. One look at their PAC funding or records makes this abundantly clear. I believe Bernie leads from a place of courage, conviction, and deep compassion, and has done so for his entire political career. In late August of 2015 my wife, son, and I took a road trip from our home in San Diego to Napa, with Bernie bumper stickers on the front and back of our car. The bumper stickers sparked a lot of, mostly positive, interactions with others, so I decided to wrap the entire car in Bernie regalia. It became clear to me that this would be a very effective way to get the word out about Bernie. My concept for the design was inspired by NASCAR race car graphics. I wanted Bernie's name emblazoned on both sides and the hood of the car with ""2016"" as the car number. I wanted to include #FeelTheBern and the, now classic, Bernie hair and glasses silhouette. Finally, instead of covering the car with corporate logos, I wanted it to be ""sponsored"" by progressive socially conscientious organizations. It had to have queer Black women Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi, and Alicia Garza's Black Lives Matter, and Bill McKibben's 350 on it, because Black liberation and global warming are two issues that are very important to me, and they are major concerns of Bernie's too. My super talented wife executed the design to perfection, and the wrap was printed and applied by Wrap City of San Diego. The car is the American made, all electric, best car in the world, Tesla Model S. Paul Sasso  For every new pic of the Bern Machine posted to this page, I will donate $1 to Bernie's campaign.

"Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016",745247932269166,Interest,"The 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, the junior United States Senator and former Congressman from Vermont, began with a formal announcement by Sanders on May 26, 2015, in Burlington, Vermont, which followed an informal announcement on April 30. Sanders had been considered a potential candidate for President of the United States since at least September 2014. Although Sanders is an independent, he caucuses with the Democratic Party in the Senate, as many of his views align with those of Democrats, and he is running for the Democratic nomination.Sanders's chief competitor for the nomination is Hillary Clinton  Martin O'Malley is a distant third place. Sanders draws large crowds to his speaking events and his populist and socialist politics have won him support from working‑class and college‑educated voters. He performs strongly with white voters but has consistently trailed Clinton by 30 or more percentage points among nonwhite voters.Sanders has stated that his campaign will focus on income and wealth inequality, which he argues is eroding the American middle class, and on campaign finance reform. Unlike most other major presidential candidates, Sanders has eschewed an unlimited super PAC, instead choosing to receive most of his funding from direct individual campaign donations. On September 30, 2015, The New York Times reported that Sanders had raised $26 million over the preceding three months, exceeding Barack Obama's 2007 pace, and that the campaign had received one million individual donations, becoming the first in 2015 to reach that threshold.",2647

Bernie Sanders - We Shall Overcome,667097380056109,Album,"The idea for this album came to me over a cup of coffee at a Burlington café. The morning regulars thought I was out of my mind, but the more I thought about it, the more intriguing the idea seemed. Our mayor, Bernie Sanders, had established himself as a no-nonsense problem solver and someone who didn’t mince words — but not the sort of person you would imagine making a record. This paradox appealed to me. When I approached Bernie with the idea, he saw it as an opportunity to tell a larger story, a story about the inequities of life in America. Suddenly, the project was more than a novelty. It had purpose. Bernie chose the music: five protest songs from the fifties and early sixties. I hired arranger Don Sidney to update the songs with contemporary rhythms. As word of the project spread among Vermont’s music community, artists lined up to volunteer their talents. By the time we began recording in November 1987, I had assembled a who’s who of the Vermont music scene: Nancy Beaven, Jon Gailmor, Dick McCormack, and Joanne “Little Joyce” Cooper, just to name a few. Thirty artists in all. When we recorded the title song, We Shall Overcome, the scene was reminiscent of the Michael Jackson “We Are The World” session. A 21-voice chorus stood on risers in the studio. A five-piece rhythm section included some of the finest players in the area. And Bernie stood at the ready in the vocal booth with his text in hand. Bernie is not a particularly musical person, but he more than made up for it with his delivery and sense of purpose. His presence in the studio electrified everyone, making this into a landmark Vermont recording. — Todd R.

Central Illinois for Bernie Sanders,1588691238042550,Community,"A relentless fighter for America's middle class and working families — a ""practical and successful legislator."" Bernie Sanders is currently serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. His previous 16 years in the House of Representatives make him the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history. Throughout his career he has focused on the shrinking American middle class and the growing income and wealth gaps in the United States. Born in 1941 in Brooklyn, Sanders attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College and the University of Chicago. After graduating in 1964, he moved to Vermont. In 1981, he was elected (by 10 votes) to the first of four terms as mayor of Burlington. Sanders lectured at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and at Hamilton College in upstate New York before his 1990 election as Vermont's at-large member in Congress. He became the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 40 years. He has caucused with the Democratic Party ever since. In 1991, Bernie was concerned that there was no organized group in Congress to represent the economic interests of the average American. Along with four other members of the House he founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has now grown to 76 members across both the House and Senate. In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the growing gap between the rich and poor. The Almanac of American Politics calls him a “practical and successful legislator.” As chairman of the Senate’s Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years,” according to Congressional Quarterly. In 2015, Bernie was tapped to serve as the Democratic Caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. As Vermont’s sole representative, Rolling Stone dubbed Bernie the “amendment king” for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress.“He accomplishes this on the one hand by being relentlessly active and on the other by using his status as an independent to form left-right coalitions,” Matt Taibbi wrote in Rolling Stone. In 1999, nine years before the Wall Street financial crisis that caused the Great Recession, Bernie voted against a bill to dismantle decades of financial regulations enacted after the Great Depression. He correctly predicted that the legislation would increase “taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail.” Bernie voted against the taxpayer bailout of Wall Street as a senator in 2008. Wall Street bankers have blocked Bernie’s legislation to break up “too-big-to-fail” banks, but in 2009, Bernie and Sen. Charles Grassley worked together to pass a bill preventing banks with taxpayer bailouts from replacing laid-off U.S. workers with low-wage foreign workers. Every year, the major credit agencies are required to give Americans a free credit report thanks to a Bernie Sanders bill passed in 2003. Bernie strongly opposed President George W. Bush’s plan to lower taxes for the wealthy and large profitable corporations. He voted against the tax breaks in 2001, and then delivered an 8 1/2 hour Senate floor “filibuster” in opposition to extending the tax cuts for the rich in 2011. In January of 2013, Bernie’s vision prevailed as he voted with the Senate majority to end the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. To create jobs and raise wages, Bernie introduced a bold $1 trillion, five-year investment in rebuilding America’s crumbling roads, bridges, railroads and other infrastructure. The bill could create an estimated 13 million decent-paying jobs. In 2013, the Senate passed an immigration reform bill with a $1.5 billion amendment from Bernie to create at least 400,000 jobs for young Americans aged 16-24. Youth unemployment remains much higher than national averages for adults as recent graduates experience difficulties with the job market. Health Care Bernie is leading a national movement toward universal, single-payer health care which would provide better care at less cost for all Americans. The senator has sponsored legislation to enact a Medicare-for-all program that would cover every American regardless of income. He believes health care must be viewed as a right of all Americans, not a privilege. To that end, Bernie has fought in Congress to increase access and lower costs for American consumers. As a House member, Bernie sponsored legislation to create a national cancer registry which Reader’s Digest called “the cancer weapon America needs the most.” He took on the powerful pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices and escorted busloads of breast cancer patients and seniors by bus from Vermont to Canada so they could buy cheaper prescription drugs. In the Senate, Bernie successfully won legislation to authorize $12.5 billion in funds for community health centers that provide primary care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs and mental health counseling for more than 25 million Americans. War and Peace Bernie opposed the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq, which dragged on for nine years and cost our nation 4,487 American troops and at least $1.7 trillion. Bernie said the war has been counterproductive in terms of fighting international terrorism. Instead, the invasion created massive volatility and instability in the region which led to the rise of radical terror groups. In 1991, Bernie voted against the first Gulf War in Iraq. As Vermont’s representative, Bernie voted for the authorization of force against the Taliban in Afghanistan, who harbored those responsible for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Social Security When President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans proposed cuts to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments in 2013, Bernie rallied a powerful coalition of seniors, women, veterans, labor unions and disabled Americans to stop them. The White House backed off the idea in its 2014 budget. He founded the Defending Social Security Caucus in 2011 and has proposed legislation to extend the solvency of the program for at least 75 years by lifting a loophole on taxable income that lets the wealthy avoid paying their fair share. Climate Change and Energy In Congress, Bernie is the lead sponsor of a bill called “the gold standard” by Sen. Barbara Boxer to address climate change by taxing carbon pollution. He wrote legislation to create an energy efficiency block grant program which has provided $3.2 billion to fund upgrades for more than 86,000 buildings and install more than 9,500 solar energy arrays. Veterans Bernie reached across the aisle to work with Republicans Sen. John McCain and Rep. Jeff Miller in passing a landmark bill to help the Department of Veterans Affairs serve millions of veterans with their earned health care and benefits. The law included $5 billion for the VA to hire more doctors and health professionals. Civil Liberties After the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed a sweeping USA Patriot Act law that enabled the government to use broad new surveillance powers. Bernie voted against the bill and opposed its reauthorization every time it arose in the House and Senate. As a supporter of marriage equality, Bernie voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in the House on July 12, 1996 and signed a friend-of-the-court brief urging justices to throw out the law. The Supreme Court finally voided the law in a 2013 ruling. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Sanders in 2014 passed legislation reforming the VA health care system. Congressional Quarterly said he was able “to bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” Today, Sanders remains on the veterans committee and was tapped by Senate leadership to be the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. He also serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he has focused on global warming and rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. He is a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where he has championed efforts to transform our energy system from fossil fuels to renewable power sources like solar and wind. He also sits on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where he has fought for greater access to affordable health care and improved education programs from pre-K to college.

Bernie Beat,1435974530036960,Media/News/Publishing,"Who is Bernie Sanders — the fist-pumping, Democratic Socialist Vermont senator who is challenging Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary? For more than four decades, the politician known simply as ‘Bernie’ has often inspired, sometimes irritated and nearly always captivated Vermonters with his trademark economic populism and, yes, that Brooklyn accent. As Sen. Sanders seeks the Democratic nomination for president, Americans will want to get to know him as well as Vermonters do. That’s why Seven Days — Vermont’s award-winning independent weekly — has launched Bernie Beat , a digital guide to Sanders’ colorful political career, from his eight years as mayor of the “People’s Republic of Burlington” to that 8 1⁄2 hour speech against Bush-era tax rates on the floor of the Senate. Seven Days dug up a treasure trove of mostly pre-digital resources — including hard-hitting articles and original source video — from more than 30 years of local Bernie-watching, to create a multimedia timeline that tells the real story of the outsider who would be president. The micro-site, which also features Bernie “singing” tunes from a long-forgotten 1987 album entitled “We Shall Overcome,” is a ready-made archive of inside information that is essential to understanding one of the nation’s most iconic public servants. Find it at http://berniebeat.com. Independently owned Seven Days was founded in 1995.

We are Greens, progressives, independents, and democratic socialists. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is a self-described democratic socialist and has built a 40-year political career on remaining independent of the Democratic Party. Sanders has called for a ""political revolution"" in the United States and is running for president in 2016. Sanders called for a political revolution in 2006, too. It didn't happen in 2006 when the Democratic majority took Congress. It didn't happen in 2008 when the Democrats kept Congress and increased their seats, and when they elected Obama. It didn't happen in 2012 when Obama was reelected. It will not happen in 2014 when Democrats are again punished by voters for their unwillingness to serve public interests (update: it is now after Nov. 4, 2014, and our prediction here was correct). In fact, the Democrats have been moving rapidly rightward. The Democrats will not bring progress, let alone a political revolution. Sanders will be unable to trigger a political revolution by tinkering within the Democratic Party or as an independent loner. If Sanders joins the Democratic Party, his radicalism will be co-opted and corrupted by the Democrats. One man cannot shift a massively powerful, neoliberal, corporatist party leftward  the massively powerful party will shift the man right toward neoliberalism.

Koch Blocker #bernie2016,862662443766927,Personal Blog,"Elections in the United States should be decided by voters, Americans who have a constitutional, fundamental right to elect their representatives. Yet, more and more we see non-voters, like Koch Industries and Americans for Prosperity, dictating the results of primaries and elections across the country. Behind these non-voting organizations are the massively wealthy men and women, hoping for a big monetary return on their political donations. When the candidates they bankroll get into office, the winners inevitably begin to legislate their sponsors’ business plans – less regulation and less oversight for corporations. Let me state this plainly for all to hear: No one should be able to pump unlimited funds into political campaigns, whether they are a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent. As one political observer noted, we currently have a campaign finance system in place which compels each party to pick which billionaires they like best. That is exactly why the system needs to change. There’s no question the Koch brothers are in a category of their own, in both degree and kind. No one else is pumping as much money into shadowy campaigns to promote issues that make themselves richer. No other individuals are recreating the role of a national political party. I understand that some people may disagree with my assessment. So I say: why not level the playing field for everyone? Let’s get this money out of our political system. Let’s undo the damage done by the Citizens United decision. Let’s do it now. The Supreme Court has equated money with speech, so the more money you have the more speech you get, and the more influence in our democracy. That is wrong. Every American should have the same ability to influence our political system. One American, one vote. That’s what the Constitution guarantees. The Constitution does not give corporations a vote. And the Constitution does not give dollar bills a vote. From what I’ve heard recently, my Republican colleagues seem to have a different view. Republicans seem to think that billionaires, corporations and special interests should be allowed to drown out the voices of Americans. That is wrong and it has to end. I oppose the notion that a big bank account should give billionaires, corporations or special interest groups a greater place in government than American voters. That is why I support the constitutional amendment proposed by two Senate Democrats, Senators Tom Udall and Michael Bennet, that curbs unlimited campaign spending. This amendment grants Congress the authority to regulate and limit the raising and spending of money for federal political campaigns. Mission: To end Citizen's United and End the take over of our Democracy by Corporate Fascism. Indict the Koch's ",1998

Florida for Bernie Sanders for President 2016,773139046114829,Community,"Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history. A self-described democratic socialist, he favors policy proposals similar to those of mainstream social democratic governments in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.He caucuses with the Democratic Party and has been the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee since January 2015. After unsuccessful candidacies for Vermont's governor and U.S. senator, Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont's most populous city, in 1981. He was reelected to three more two-year mayoral terms before being elected to represent Vermont's at-large congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in 1990. He served as a congressman for 16 years before being elected to succeed the retiring Republican-turned-independent Jim Jeffords in the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, he was re-elected by a large margin, capturing almost 71% of the popular vote. Since his election to the Senate, Sanders has emerged as a leading progressive voice on issues like income inequality, climate change, and campaign finance reform. He rose to national prominence on the heels of his 2010 filibuster of the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy. Sanders is also outspoken on civil liberties issues, and has been particularly critical of mass surveillance policies such as the Patriot Act. Sanders announced his intentions to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for President on April 30, 2015, in an address on the Capitol lawn.

Hidalgo for Bernie Sanders,1581598805424260,Political Organization," About Meet Bernie Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. In 2006, he was elected to the U.S. Senate after 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives. Bernie is now serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College, and the University of Chicago. After graduating, he moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington, the state’s largest city, by a mere 10 votes. As mayor, Bernie’s leadership helped transform Burlington into one of the most exciting and livable small cities in America. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the shrinking middle class and growing gap between the rich and everyone else. Bernie has been called a “practical and successful legislator” and he was dubbed the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” In 2015, Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Bernie lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane. He has four children and seven grandchildren  Hidalgo Progressives joining together for Bernie Sanders 2016 Presidential Campaign. ",1173

Let's get organized to help Bernie win in 2016, stop the right-wing Republicans and counter the Wall Street dominated Democratic Party establishment. Millions of people are fed up with establishment politics. The momentum behind Bernie Sanders gives us a real chance to gather together everyone who wants to build a real alternative for the 99%. We can turn this into the most important election in decades by building an organized political force behind the Sanders campaign to fight against racism, sexism and corporate domination. To do this, we need a political movement that can build protests and direct action while running independent candidates who refuse to take corporate cash. Bernie's campaign offers the opportunity to fight back. He has opened up an urgently needed debate about an alternative to capitalism, democratic socialism. We need a vibrant and visible campaign in every workplace, campus, and community that actively takes up low wages, racism and environmental destruction. We need public meetings and protests connecting Bernie's campaign to the struggles against injustice created by the system. If we get organized in a big way, we can bring millions behind us into Bernie's campaign to win in 2016. We can begin to build a new, lasting, and powerful force - based on the independent power of working people and not big business - that can lead a fight back against the billionaire class and their politicians from both parties after the 2016 election is over.  “Even the best President in the world cannot take on the billionaire class alone. We need a mass movement of millions.” - Bernie Sanders",1088

Our entire effort is focused on one tenet you must vote in every election local, state, and nationally and vote your interests to get real representation and governance. Millennials Rise will continue after this election working to keep up pressure on representatives to initiate President Sanders legislation and proposals. Furthermore we will ramp up effort to restore sanity to our statehouses. We will continue our efforts building grassroots organizations whose sole purpose is to get millennials registered to vote and to the polls to vote for their interests in every election. Our Hometown Ambassador Program’s plan of action is based on the basic premise that many college students visit their hometowns during the school year and they have friends, siblings, acquaintances, old classmates and are part of their hometown millennial scene. They are the perfect ambassadors to get millennials in almost every hamlet, town, suburb, and city neighborhood registered, involved, and educated to vote from now on. In 5 years we will all be voting over the internet. It is in our interest and we can make it the law if we vote in all elections, then voting problem solved. Our other grassroots program , The High School Voter Drive Challenge, plan of action is premised on the rivalries that already exist in sports, charity drives etc. between schools. Let the challenge begin! This program will be a priority for ambassadors to promote back home. We can do a college challenge too! On the Legislative front we have an initiative to make being registered to vote as a requisite to graduate from high school. Voting is a civic duty that has too long been ignored to the detriment of our very own interests. In summary, We believe that these programs can initiate an awakening within the millennial generation and we can begin to start taking control of our destiny now. Your political organizations participation is crucial to the success of our plan in your state. Enclosed is a more detailed summary of the plans of action for the grassroots programs we are initiating. Please contact us with any questions and hopefully we can work together to elect responsive representation and governance.

Puerto Rico for Bernie Sanders,773208672778539,Political Organization," We Are People for Bernie We are activists and organizers trying to build a broad, effective movement for democratic change. We come from different backgrounds, and were inspired by different issues and fights for peace, rights and the planet. Our goal is a government that carries out the will of the people, and not serve to increase the profits of the 1% at the expense of the rest of us. To that end we support Bernie Sanders in his bid to become the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. We stand firmly behind Senator Sanders as the strongest progressive possibility in the race right now. His commitment to our values is one of long standing commitment. Sanders is the bold alternative. As a truly progressive candidate for the Democratic Party nomination, Senator Sanders has the chance to inspire millions of Americans with policy proposals that put the interests of the 99%, front and center. Franklin D. Roosevelt called out the “economic royalists” of his day. Senator Sanders is picking up the banner. He answers to “We the People” and not to the corporate and financial sectors. Bernie brings the kind of leadership that is necessary to building a real, living democracy. The initiators of this letter are veteran grassroots organizers of Occupy Wall Street, and are joined by many energized brothers and sisters we have met along the way. In September 2011, our efforts changed the narrative of American politics, helping to focus it on the issues of our time: inequality, surrender to the power of concentrated wealth, the corruption of our democracy by moneyed interests, and the need for solutions as radical as our problems. We are signing as individuals hoping to kickstart a small ‘d’ democratic movement. People For Bernie won’t be a corporate-style, staff-driven, controlled-message, top-down enterprise. It will reflect diverse constituencies from a broad range of movements, which in many cases haven’t seen the Democratic Party as a home for their deepest aspirations. It will reflect our commitment to fundamental change, not just a change of faces at the top of the political pyramid. People for Bernie it will reflect the urgency of more and fiercer grassroots political activity at the base. We call on all other progressive forces to unite behind Sanders so we can have a united front in this important campaign.  For business inquiries contact us at: puertoricoforsanders@gmail.com",930

Daybreak Star Cultural Center,143270392356587,Landmark,"The Daybreak Star Cultural Center is a Native American cultural center in Seattle, Washington, described by its parent organization United Indians of All Tribes as ""an urban base for Native Americans in the Seattle area."" Located on 20 acres (81,000 m²) in Seattle's Discovery Park in the Magnolia neighborhood, the center developed from activism by Bernie Whitebear and other Native Americans, who staged a generally successful self-styled ""invasion"" and occupation of the land in 1970. Most of the former Fort Lawton military base had been declared surplus by the U.S. Department of Defense. ""The claim to Fort Lawton was based on rights under 1865 U.S.-Indian treaties promising reversion of surplus military lands to their original owners.""The existing building, a work of modern architecture incorporating many elements of traditional Northwest Native architecture, was designed by Arai Jackson Architects and Planners and completed in 1977. In 2004, plans were approved to supplement it with a complex of three additional related buildings, to be known as the People's Lodge. This was Whitebear's final dream project before he died of cancer in 2000. But in 2006, after agreements had been reached between the tribes, the city and nearby residents on a reduced size for the new project, the Center decided to postpone construction indefinitely for lack of funds.Daybreak Star, a major nucleus of Native American cultural activity in its region, functions as a conference center, a location for pow wows, the location for a Head Start school program, and an art gallery. The center's permanent art collection includes a variety of large art works by and about Native Americans, notably Blue Jay, a 30-foot (9 m) wide, 12 foot (3.7 m) high sculpture by Lawney Reyes, Whitebear's brother. It was commissioned by and hung prominently for more than 30 years at the Bank of California building in downtown Seattle. (After the Bank of California merged with Union Bank in 1996 to form Union Bank of California, the work was donated to the Daybreak Star Center.) Also included in that donation was a major oil painting by Guy Anderson, based on a traditional Northwest Native representation of a whale. ",738

Nurses For Bernie Sanders,560113740796229,Political Organization,"I have been amazed by the outpouring of grassroots support that we have secured. While my opponents hold fundraising events in which a handful of millionaires make huge contributions, we are gaining extraordinary support with modest contributions coming from the working families and middle class of our country. That's what my politics is all about. That's what I want to do throughout this campaign. And I want to thank all of you for your support. This campaign will take on the biggest challenges facing our country. We must stand up and fight back. We must launch a political revolution which engages millions of Americans from all walks of life in the struggle for real change. Here's what this campaign is going to talk about: Income and wealth inequality: In the United States today we have the most unequal wealth and income distribution of any major country on earth -- worse than at any time since the 1920s. This is an economy that must be changed in fundamental ways. Jobs and income: In my view, we need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work. We must end our disastrous trade policies. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And we have to fight for pay equity for women. Campaign finance reform: As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, American democracy is being undermined by the ability of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families. These wealthy contributors can literally buy politicians and elections by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the candidates of their choice. We need to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections so that all candidates can run for office without being beholden to the wealthy and powerful. Climate change: Climate change is real, caused by human activity and already devastating our nation and planet. The United States must lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainability. College affordability: Every person in this country who has the desire and ability should be able to get all the education they need regardless of the income of their family. This is not a radical idea. In Germany, Scandinavia and many other countries, higher education is either free or very inexpensive. We must do the same. Health care: Shamefully, the United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right, not a privilege. Poverty: The United States has more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the modern history of our country. I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation. We need to expand Social Security, not cut it. We need to increase funding for nutrition programs, not cut them. Tax reform: We need real tax reform which makes the rich and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes. We need a tax system which is fair and progressive. Children should not go hungry in this country while profitable corporations and the wealthy avoid their tax responsibilities by stashing their money in the Cayman Islands. And these are just some of the issues that we will be dealing with. The struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. The struggle to try and create a more peaceful world will be extremely difficult. But this I know: despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet. This country belongs to all of us, not just the billionaire class. That's what our campaign is all about, but it cannot be won by me alone. That is absolutely for sure. To win this campaign, all of us must be deeply involved. In the coming days, weeks, and months we need to hear your ideas as to what issues are most important in your communities. We need to hear your thoughts about how we can mount the effective campaign we need to win. We need your help in spreading the word so that your friends, neighbors and co-workers become involved in the effort.  ",715

Pitt Students for Bernie Sanders 2016,111792912497392,Community,"As the official group under the national banner, 'College Students for Bernie', We are so excited for what's in store for this year at Pitt. As we all know this election is probably the most crucial election of our generation. If a republican gets elected it will set our country back 30 years in civil rights and equality for all. The gap in wealth continues to grow and the nation's debt has become the burden of working class people. After the great depression the wealthy bailed this country out through a high flat tax rate and we endured 30+ great years of prosperity, but those times are changing due to the timely negative effects of Reaganomics. Bernie has integrity like no other politician in the history of our lives and he owns it. While his competitor is still courting billionaires and hiring corporate lobbyists, Bernie refuses to do so and instead relies on the younger, social media savvy population of students and young adults to join the political revolution that is sweeping the nation. We don't want a billionaire controlled government that does not support our best interests as a united country. We need someone who is willing to stand up to the billionaire class and say, "" We're mad as hell and we're not going to take this anymore!"" Bernie is that man and I hope you will stand strong with us this school year in spreading the word with all of your classmates and continue to grow this grassroots, volunteer based campaign.

Bernie Sanders for President,855292354560212,Community,"Florida says just spread keep the word!!!! Seriously, has anyone voted more on the correct side of the major issues of our time? Senator Sanders introduced a bill to prohibit offshore drilling in 2010. He has been vocal in his opposition to Citizens United and McCutcheon, is for marriage and pay equality. He is for states requiring labeling regarding GMO's, voted to expand Social Security benefits and introduced a bill to break up the BIG BANKS. He wants to stop fracking, is a friend to Labor and for $15, and importantly against TPP. He's voted against NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, ending Glass Steagall, the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, the Bank Bailout and Keystone XL. We've had corporate presidents for over thirty years. Bill Clinton, ended Glass Steagall, signed NAFTA into law, Obama, puts fast track on TPP free trade agreement, over the objections of most Democrats in congress. Senator Sanders is the hardest working Senator in the Senate, his reward, more knowledge than most. His record shows he is for the middle class. It is critical we have a people's president, with 33% of jobs now done by Americans being done by technology in ten short years, hardest hit, white collar positions. Add to that that number the jobs lost from TPP and the line of free trade agreements waiting in line to be passed or still being negotiated, we could see unemployment of over 30%. During the height of the Great Depression unemployment, 28-29%.

The Revolution Starts With Us,722059347924491,Community,"Bernie Sanders has said: “We need a political revolution in this country involving millions of people who are prepared to stand up and say ‘enough is enough’. “ We are those people, and we are committed to the radical transformation of our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally. On Monday, February 1, 2016, our revolution begins in Iowa. Bernie has said “If we win in Iowa and New Hampshire, it opens up for us a path toward victory.” He is now well ahead in New Hampshire, and, according to a recent CBS/YouGov poll, only 5 points behind in Iowa.

University of Vermont Students for Bernie Sanders,1671303266431550,Community,"Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. In 2006, he was elected to the U.S. Senate after 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives. Bernie is now serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Learn more about Bernie's life and career with an interactive timeline.VIEW TIMELINE Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College, and the University of Chicago. After graduating, he moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington, the state’s largest city, by a mere 10 votes. As mayor, Bernie’s leadership helped transform Burlington into one of the most exciting and livable small cities in America. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. Bernie and Jane In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the shrinking middle class and growing gap between the rich and everyone else. Bernie has been called a “practical and successful legislator” and he was dubbed the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” In 2015, Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Bernie lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane. He has four children and seven grandchildren. - From the Sanders2016 Website Bernie Sanders is the only politician running for president whose policies work to change serious social and ecological issues.

Valparaiso For Bernie Sanders,1626012954324440,Community,"My fellow Americans: This country faces more serious problems today than at any time since the Great Depression and, if you include the planetary crisis of climate change, it may well be that the challenges we face now are direr than any time in our modern history. Here is my promise to you for this campaign. Not only will I fight to protect the working families of this country, but we’re going to build a movement of millions of Americans who are prepared to stand up and fight back. We’re going to take this campaign directly to the people – in town meetings, door to door conversations, on street corners and in social media – and that’s BernieSanders.com by the way. This week we will be in New Hampshire, Iowa and Minnesota – and that’s just the start of a vigorous grassroots campaign. Let’s be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Jeb Bush or anyone else. This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs. As someone who has never run a negative political ad in his life, my campaign will be driven by issues and serious debate; not political gossip, not reckless personal attacks or character assassination. This is what I believe the American people want and deserve. I hope other candidates agree, and I hope the media allows that to happen. Politics in a democratic society should not be treated like a baseball game, a game show or a soap opera. The times are too serious for that. ... We can live in a country: Where every person has health care as a right, not a privilege; Where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college; Where every senior can live in dignity and security, and not be forced to choose between their medicine or their food; Where every veteran who defends this nation gets the quality health care and benefits they have earned and receives the respect they deserve; Where every person, no matter their race, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans. That is the nation we can build together, and I ask you to join me in this campaign to build a future that works for all of us, and not just the few on top. -Bernie Sanders announcing his candidacy (5-26-2015) This page serves as an organizing hub for Valparaiso residents who support Sen.

America For Bernie Sanders,421523201360740,Political Organization,"I have been amazed by the outpouring of grassroots support that we have secured. While my opponents hold fundraising events in which a handful of millionaires make huge contributions, we are gaining extraordinary support with modest contributions coming from the working families and middle class of our country. That's what my politics is all about. That's what I want to do throughout this campaign. And I want to thank all of you for your support. This campaign will take on the biggest challenges facing our country. We must stand up and fight back. We must launch a political revolution which engages millions of Americans from all walks of life in the struggle for real change. Here's what this campaign is going to talk about: Income and wealth inequality: In the United States today we have the most unequal wealth and income distribution of any major country on earth -- worse than at any time since the 1920s. This is an economy that must be changed in fundamental ways. Jobs and income: In my view, we need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work. We must end our disastrous trade policies. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And we have to fight for pay equity for women. Campaign finance reform: As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, American democracy is being undermined by the ability of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families. These wealthy contributors can literally buy politicians and elections by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the candidates of their choice. We need to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections so that all candidates can run for office without being beholden to the wealthy and powerful. Climate change: Climate change is real, caused by human activity and already devastating our nation and planet. The United States must lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainability. College affordability: Every person in this country who has the desire and ability should be able to get all the education they need regardless of the income of their family. This is not a radical idea. In Germany, Scandinavia and many other countries, higher education is either free or very inexpensive. We must do the same. Health care: Shamefully, the United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right, not a privilege. Poverty: The United States has more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the modern history of our country. I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation. We need to expand Social Security, not cut it. We need to increase funding for nutrition programs, not cut them. Tax reform: We need real tax reform which makes the rich and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes. We need a tax system which is fair and progressive. Children should not go hungry in this country while profitable corporations and the wealthy avoid their tax responsibilities by stashing their money in the Cayman Islands. And these are just some of the issues that we will be dealing with. The struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. The struggle to try and create a more peaceful world will be extremely difficult. But this I know: despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet. This country belongs to all of us, not just the billionaire class. That's what our campaign is all about, but it cannot be won by me alone. That is absolutely for sure. To win this campaign, all of us must be deeply involved. In the coming days, weeks, and months we need to hear your ideas as to what issues are most important in your communities. We need to hear your thoughts about how we can mount the effective campaign we need to win. We need your help in spreading the word so that your friends, neighbors and co-workers become involved in the effort.  ",538

Here's what this campaign is going to talk about: Income and wealth inequality: In the United States today we have the most unequal wealth and income distribution of any major country on earth -- worse than at any time since the 1920s. This is an economy that must be changed in fundamental ways. Jobs and income: In my view, we need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work. We must end our disastrous trade policies. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And we have to fight for pay equity for women. Campaign finance reform: As a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, American democracy is being undermined by the ability of the Koch brothers and other billionaire families. These wealthy contributors can literally buy politicians and elections by spending hundreds of millions of dollars in support of the candidates of their choice. We need to overturn Citizens United and move toward public funding of elections so that all candidates can run for office without being beholden to the wealthy and powerful. Climate change: Climate change is real, caused by human activity and already devastating our nation and planet. The United States must lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainability. College affordability: Every person in this country who has the desire and ability should be able to get all the education they need regardless of the income of their family. This is not a radical idea. In Germany, Scandinavia and many other countries, higher education is either free or very inexpensive. We must do the same. Health care: Shamefully, the United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right, not a privilege. Poverty: The United States has more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the modern history of our country. I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation. We need to expand Social Security, not cut it. We need to increase funding for nutrition programs, not cut them. Tax reform: We need real tax reform which makes the rich and profitable corporations begin to pay their fair share of taxes. We need a tax system which is fair and progressive. Children should not go hungry in this country while profitable corporations and the wealthy avoid their tax responsibilities by stashing their money in the Cayman Islands. And these are just some of the issues that we will be dealing with. The struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. The struggle to try and create a more peaceful world will be extremely difficult. But this I know: despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet. This country belongs to all of us, not just the billionaire class. That's what our campaign is all about, but it cannot be won by me alone. That is absolutely for sure. To win this campaign, all of us must be deeply involved. In the coming days, weeks, and months we need to hear your ideas as to what issues are most important in your communities. We need to hear your thoughts about how we can mount the effective campaign we need to win. We need your help in spreading the word so that your friends, neighbors and co-workers become involved in the effort.  ",537
Bernie Sanders for President 2016,855636854505982,Community,"Outspoken, honest, and with a consistent track record, Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential bid is unique among either side of the candidacies. The Independent US Senator does what truly democratic politicians are meant to- represent every citizen of the nation, not the select few millionaires and billionaires who finance campaigns. Senator Sanders is a strong proponent of reclaiming elections for the people, and putting power back in the hands of of everyday Americans by overturning the democratically disastrous Citizens United. Other concerns he actively and consistently advocates for are the pressing issues of climate change, unemployment, and rebuilding infrastructure. More information can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders https://berniesanders.com/ http://www.sanders.senate.gov/ Bernie Sanders is the only time-proven, bold, and financially autonomous option.

Irish Americans for Bernie Sanders,1677710645796940,Organization,"Typically not me but when the future of my five little O'Briens hinges a lot on this next election I would like everyone to think of history and how the Irish-Americans got here. How we made the infrastructure that built this country and how our great grandfathers and grandfathers broke their backs for us to have a home, prosper and not be financially burdened and ridiculed by the English. Our heritage built the steel towers the rich now reside. It's time to take it back. It's time to level the playing field. Indentured servitude is over, the days of putting in a hard weeks work to see it not go as far as it did a few months ago. Constantly watching our paycheck be eaten alive by high insurance costs just so our kids can be kids. If you step back and look historically it feels as if the proverbial English rich have returned. We are the middle class we built this and we need to own it. I'm not asking for you to vote but just to listen. Listen to how he doesn't side step a question, he answers it. I'm not a political person or a writer but this man is one of us, and I have his back. Thanks cousins for listening. That's all I ask. www.berniesanders.com Irish-Americans were the backbone of this country and this page is dedicated to the support of a man who stands for the same blue collar values. ",524

We, brothers and sisters of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, vote like our jobs depend on it, because they do. As such, it is becoming abundantly clear that Senator bernie Sanders from Vermont represents our best chance in the 2016 Presidential Election to have our voices heard and unions strengthened. Senator Sanders has long been an advocate of unions and, unlike his competition, has not worked for anti-union law firms nor sat on the board of one of the largest anti-union companies in the world in Walmart. He also does not take money from Super PACs and voted against various trade deals that harm workers' rights and job prospects. He fights for a $15 minimum wage and free education for all. He has a great chance to win the nomination and oval office, but he can't do it alone. We need YOU to get registered, vote, and vote your interests. We need a democrat-led house, senate, and a POTUS that fights for us, not against us. #SandersforPresident #TeamstersforSanders #FeeltheBern Rallying Page for Teamsters to raise support for Bernie Sanders' 2016 Nomination. http://laborforbernie.org/",524

Bernie Sanders for President 2016: East Central Indiana,445007678994355,Political Party,"Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College, and the University of Chicago. After graduating, he moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington, the state’s largest city, by a mere 10 votes. As mayor, Bernie’s leadership helped transform Burlington into one of the most exciting and livable small cities in America. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. Bernie and Jane In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the shrinking middle class and growing gap between the rich and everyone else. Bernie has been called a “practical and successful legislator” and he was dubbed the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” In 2015, Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Bernie lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane. He has four children and seven grandchildren. Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States.

Unlike Bernie I would under no circumstances support Hillary Clinton and will not sit back and relax while I see her posing a danger to the ideas I hold dear to my heart....

The Accidental Socialist,1643166792594220,Website,"The Accidental Socialist (""TAS"") was started near the beginning of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign by a couple of guys who, like millions of Bernie's supporters, may have thought of themselves as liberals or progressives, but never socialists, democratic or otherwise. The more Sen. Sanders traveled, the bigger the crowds got, and the more Americans discovered that democratic socialism is not only compatible with American values - it is at their core. In a market economy like America's, some level of socioeconomic inequality is inevitable, and many would say desirable because it provides an incentive to produce and innovate. However, once that level of inequality passes a certain point, growing a strong middle class, making quality education and social mobility accessible to everyone who works hard, those true American values become impossible because those at the bottom have no resources beyond mere survival. Here at TAS, we see that America today has reached that point, a position that is no longer at the political fringe, but has entered the mainstream. Income and wealth inequality has been growing for over 40 years, and it has now reached levels not seen since the late 1920s, just before the Stock Market crash that triggered the Great Depression. This record economic inequality has begun to transform our politics, as those at the top have begun to change the rules to favor of protecting their interests while making it more and more difficult for the rest of us below to effect change. The most visible of these policies is the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which has effectively opened our campaign finance system to unlimited money, allowing billionaires to buy elections. However, not everyone agrees on what to do about it. At TAS, we believe that to restore the Middle Class which existed in America in the middle of the 20th century, we must have government policies which more closely resemble those of that era, when over a third of the workforce was unionized and jobs were available to high school graduates which could support entire families, when paying for a year's worth of public university education didn't require eternal student debt, but only a minimum wage job during the summer, when health care costs didn't rise several times the rate of inflation and where government was massively investing in infrastructure which would later be used by businesses nationwide to grow our economy. The only solution to reverse the decline is to enact both spending as well as tax policies which will narrow the gap between rich and poor, and the proceeds of said taxes to be used to create high paying jobs, invest in infrastructure, and make education, health care and other services both qualitative as well as affordable. But as Bernie Sanders has told us, this is not an easy task because there are powerful entrenched interests which very much like the system as it is, and the only way to beat it is for millions of Americans to mobilize and bring about a political revolution. We here are doing our part, which is why all of the profits from TAS are being invested to promote Americans for Bernie Sanders, a social media group dedicated exclusively to educating Americans about Bernie's vision and campaign, and winning over new converts. We look forward to you joining us. TAS team TAS is one of the many responses to Bernie Sanders' call for a political revolution. Stay up to date with Bernie's campaign, news and other events. ",420

Bernie is now serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he attended James Madison High School, Brooklyn College, and the University of Chicago. After graduating, he moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington, the state’s largest city, by a mere 10 votes. As mayor, Bernie’s leadership helped transform Burlington into one of the most exciting and livable small cities in America. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. Bernie and Jane In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the shrinking middle class and growing gap between the rich and everyone else. Bernie has been called a “practical and successful legislator” and he was dubbed the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” In 2015, Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Bernie lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane. He has four children and seven grandchildren.

Unlimited money from corporate interests, lobbyists, and the 1% continue to influence who is elected to office and what laws get passed. There is more income inequality now than there has been since the Great Depression. Many issues of racial and gender inequality have come to the forefront of the national consciousness. This is why we need Bernie Sanders as president in 2016. Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent in American Congressional history, having first been elected to the House in 1990 and to the Senate in 2006. He gains widespread support from both parties for his honesty and commitment to his ideals as well as his tireless working towards them, leading to him winning both his Senate campaigns with over 65% of the vote. With a progressive history dating back to his college days in the 1960's, Bernie Sanders has been consistent in his calling for income equality, racial equality, gender equality, infrastructure improvements, universal healthcare, ending corporate and moneyed interests in politics, addressing climate change, and affordable higher education for all.

We have to realize that solving big problems isn't about my “ism” vs. your “ism.” At least it’s not for me. If you’re reading this, I hope that might be true about you too. That being said, it does seem like we are at one of those times in human history where people are being asked to choose a side: the side of free thinking … or the side of a future that, without hyperbole, looks frighteningly on its way to becoming Orwell’s Oceania. Popular revolutions start by growing relationships around a shared purpose. In a 1967 speech on his opposition to the Vietnam War, Dr. King called for “a radical revolution in values” to combat what he said were “the giant triplets of racism, militarism, and economic exploitation.” Of course, that’s only partially about changing who is in power. Even more importantly, it’s about substantively changing the way we see the people around us. In order for Bernie to win this thing, he’ll need resources. But it has to be about more than fundraising. It has to be about combating the bad information marketing machine that permeates our society. Doing that will require a personal politics focused on similarities, not differences. It takes just as much energy to engage with your neighbor in a positive way as it does to ignore them. And it’s in those connections that real change happens. The Northern Virginia area wants to elect Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in 2016. Please invite your friends!",232

The United States now has the distinction of having one of the greatest disparities in its wealth distribution. Bernie Sanders supports the working class and seeks to bring back the middle class by cosponsoring and introducing bills concerning a 15 dollar minimum wage, a major jobs program to repair our crumbling infrastructure, and legislation to require employers to provide paid vacation and sick leave. He also believes in investing in education and has put forth a bill to make tuition free for all who wish to pursue a college degree, as well as supporting legislation that reduces interest rates on student loans. Sanders has long been an advocate for equality for all people regardless of gender, race, or sexual orientation. He believes in the need to reform our criminal justice system and has called for change in how our police officers are trained  shifting from militarized local police forces to more community policing, which he instituted in Burlington as mayor. Senator Sanders also seeks to require body cameras on all police officers to help ensure integrity and accountability in our legal enforcement system. Bernie believes it is time we take climate change seriously and that we must transform our current energy system towards efficient and sustainable practices. He has led the opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and secured $3.2 billion in a stimulus package for grants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Elected Mayor of Burlington by 10 votes in 1981, he served four terms. Before his 1990 election as Vermont's at-large member in Congress, Sanders lectured at the John F.

Yoopers for Bernie Sanders,1448283152142650,Community,"1.Health Care For All “Medicare-for-all” single-payer healthcare plan that is similar to programs in most developed democratic nations. Maybe it is time for this option. We believe it is real change that counts and for the government to see to it that people have help in paying hospital and doctors bills. 2.Time Now to tax the Rich. The time for Real change to transfer the wealth back from the top tenth of 1 percent.For to long the rich are only getting richer. This “massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent” in America is called obscene and morally wrong. Mr. Sanders called for a return to a much higher marginal tax rate. We are bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people aren’t paying what’s fair in federal taxes. We are dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S. 3.Tuition-Free College Time for Real change where there is a plan to provide free education at public colleges funded by a small tax on Wall Street transactions. The burden of college tuition is crushing for many American households. 4.Campaign Finance Reform Money in politics stinks and has too much influence on elections. Mr.Sanders campaign shunned super PAC support funded by undisclosed billionaires .The wealthy have the most influence and we want to limit the amount of money individuals can contribute to political campaigns. Maybe it is time to completely rebuild the funding for campaigns. 5. Same-Sex Marriage For 4 decades Mr.Sanders has been a supporter of the right to marry same sex couples. The Supreme Court just recently expanded the right to marry to same-sex couples. Mr. Sanders voting against the 1996’s Defense of Marriage Act and supporting his state’s 2000 legalization of same-sex marriage. Maybe Mr.Sanders calls him a Democratic Socialist….but look at the attendance of his meetings and now that it is time for Real change maybe , his views are hardly out-of-step with American voters. .  People are finally ready for Real Change. See how Mr. Sanders views are hardly out-of-step with American voters.",205

Bernie is now serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote. In Congress, Bernie has fought tirelessly for working families, focusing on the shrinking middle class and growing gap between the rich and everyone else. Bernie has been called a “practical and successful legislator” and he was dubbed the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member of Congress. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Bernie worked across the aisle to “bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.” In 2015, Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Bernie lives in Burlington, Vermont with his wife Jane.

Veterans for Bernie Sanders - Wisconsin,1073116532699760,Political Organization,"We are veterans committed to helping elect a President who will make veterans’ issues a priority. Although we hail from all walks of life, and have served during peacetime as well as in times of war, our shared goal is to elect a Commander-in-Chief who truly honors the personal sacrifices made by those who have served in our nation’s Armed Forces. To that end, we are proud to enthusiastically support Bernie Sanders for President in 2016. For decades, Bernie Sanders has stood with us. He has fought to preserve benefits for veterans and improve health care at the VA, for appropriate services for women veterans, for better education and employment opportunities, and for improved access to mental health programs. Now, we stand with Bernie Sanders. In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln vowed 'to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, [and] to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.' Bernie Sanders is guided by that same belief — that as a nation, we have a solemn obligation to make sure that all veterans get the benefits and timely access to quality services that they earned and are entitled to. Last year, as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Bernie Sanders successfully led a bi-partisan effort to pass the most far-reaching veterans legislation in decades; to expand veterans’ health care, establish dozens of new VA clinics, hire more doctors and nurses, and increase transparency and accountability at the VA. The bill also guarantees that recently separated veterans get in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, and extends educational benefits to surviving spouses of veterans who died in the line of duty. 'Veterans everywhere should be proud and comforted to know that this United States Senator has their back in Congress.' These are real achievements, rather than the empty promises and hollow platitudes we so often hear from Washington. It is no wonder that the VFW honored Bernie Sanders with its prestigious Congressional Award this past March, noting, 'Veterans everywhere should be proud and comforted to know that this United States Senator has their back in Congress.' But perhaps Bernie Sanders’ greatest contribution in Congress has been to repeatedly remind his colleagues who insist we don’t have the money to provide veterans with the highest quality care and benefits: 'If we can’t afford to take care of our veterans, then maybe we shouldn’t go to war.' No one knows more about serving their country than veterans. In line with our mission of continued service at home, we strive to take personal ownership of our political system, for that is the only way to make our nation great once again. Like those who came before us, our oath to defend the Constitution — and the fundamental principles upon which this nation was founded — never expires. As such, we call on all veterans, and all active duty and reserve service-members to join us and rally behind Bernie Sanders in his march to the Oval Office. United as one, WE are Vets for Bernie! - vetsforbernie.org  We call on all veterans, and all active duty and reserve service-members to join us and rally behind Bernie Sanders in his march to the Oval Office!

Bernie Sanders is the one steadfast politician who has spent his entire career doggedly advocating for working and middle class families and prioritizing the issues we face.

There's Incredible Opportunity for us to all coordinate and support each other's efforts. Imagine if you will, Austin and San Antonio Bernie Groups coordinating and supporting each other's public rallies. The net effect being double the crowd sizes at both. Imagine how many we could reach by simply making the effort to ensure Bernie yard signs are located close to the Gates at Fort Hood. Imagine the untapped wellspring of canvassers that could be enlisted from the Campuses of A & M and UTA. For this reason, we've created a new Facebook Group called ""Greater Fort Hood For Bernie Sanders, 2016"". If you live in Central Texas, and have decided to support Bernie, WE NEED EACH OTHER! The celebratory period since Bernie's announcement has been wonderful But there's a lot of work that needs to be done. We need 5K signatures to get Bernie on the primary ballot.

If Trump Becomes President I'm Leaving the USA,996715643684089,Community,"From Bernie Sanders: It's up to our campaign to contact other voters, bring them into our movement, and turn them out to vote. I want to be very clear about something though: You are our movement. We don't have any billionaires waiting in the wings with bags of cash, no saviors from the oligarchy ready to swoop in and save the day. It's YOU. There's no one else except for ordinary Americans who are tired of the influence of the billionaire class. Now, there's a lot of us — but we need to come together, get organized, and win. So I need to ask you: can you step up and contribute $3 to our campaign? Our opponents have been running TV ads since early summer. They're funding their campaigns with checks from billionaires and Wall Street. We always knew we would be outspent, but we can make sure we're not out-organized. What we are offering is a chance for Americans to not just get involved in the political process, but to take it back from the billionaire class. Our grassroots movement is organizing, communicating, and connecting in communities across the country. Together, we can dismantle this corrupt political system — one phone call, one flyer, one conversation at a time. This kind of real organizing work is being done at a scale not seen elsewhere in this election. Tens of thousands of people turned out over the last week and made an incredible number of calls to voters in early states, helping identify who will come to the polls for Bernie. It's thanks to folks like these: “I phonebanked for an hour then taught another person how to phone bank, and we made plans to start meeting regularly. It felt great to say, 'I'm a volunteer for Bernie Sanders.'"" - Sylvia from CO “The people who signed up actually came, and completely filled up my small living room. It was cozy! Lots of discussion and diverse ages! After explaining why the campaign is asking for people to phone bank in the early primary states, I was very surprised at how many people volunteered to phone bank! People also wanted to attend more events, canvass, and use their special skills for the campaign. I encouraged them to apply online, and I will follow up with them. Most of them expressed a desire to develop an ongoing local group to promote Bernie's campaign.” - Catherine from NJ “I fed everyone dinner and then, we had a quick training on the Virtual Phone Bank. Afterwards, four people started making calls. It was decided this event was so much fun, that one of our newbies decided to hold an event at her house on Monday - just three days later!! - to repeat the dinner and phone banking event! Everyone agreed to come to her event - even our guest that traveled almost 2 hours to get here!” - Robin from TX “We had a very pleasant experience with our first phone-banking event. Six people signed up and three showed, all with very positive attitudes and willing to work. The first hour was spent with introductions (we were all new to each other) and an orientation for the process. After that we all just called for about an hour and a half! It was a productive event and I can see how if thousands of volunteers around the country do this work we WILL make a difference in the early states.” - Fernando from CA This is who will help us win. Folks like Sylvia, Catherine, Robin, Fernando, and thousands of others who want to take back our corrupt political system. The only way we can win — countering the influence of Wall Street, health insurance companies, and the rest of America's oligarchy — is if enough people come together to join our movement. So, are you in? Contribute $3 to our campaign to show the billionaire class that ENOUGH is ENOUGH. Help us win this. Thank you, deeply, for everything you do. In solidarity, Bernie Sanders https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/join-our-movement?refcode=em151116full Please contribute at least $3 to our campaign to tell the billionaire class you've had enough of them buying our elections!

Woodsington Post,203313519870872,Society/Culture Website,"Delivering the latest in REAL NEWS. Always with the intent of identifying and solving current domestic and world issues. The views I use to pick the news Taxes are harder now than they have ever been on 99% of Americans and we should have considerably less debt. But its' because 99% of wages have gone down, so since the top .0000001% own 50% ish of the wealth nowdays they need the tax bracket to match. also multinational corporations may make some jobs but not as many as the millions of middle class families their money use to go to 50 years ago. i think everyone should be able to buy any gun with enough training and clearance similar to what we have right now, and that anyone, barring a history of violence or terrorism, should be able to buy most guns. but absolutely no one with a record of violence or terrorism should be able to buy or sell one gun. I think the second amendment mentions a well regulated militia long before it mentions citizens right to bear arms, and as such we we can as long as we regulate violent folk and terrorists appropriately. I think we need to get people off of welfare and into work but i dont think cutting welfare will do it, i think the welfare net is catching the collapsing middle class and that the only way to stop it isnt to destroy the net but to give the middle class a way out with survivable wages, education and work reinvigorating our infrastructure and investing in america, so they can consume, fuel the economy, build savings, buy houses, invest, start small business'. i believe that terrorism is a threat and that the us must lead abroad and stand for the principals of democracy and freedom but that regime change is counter effective, that it would be a financial boondoggle to fight another decade, kill another million foreigners, another 4000 american soldiers, and another 3 trillion dollars to try and force democracy on a people who aren't sure they want it, all to try and prevent terrorist attacks that physically effect a few thousand people at most. I also believe saving 200,000 of what are reliably our hardest working and most constructive citizens is as important for our economy as combating terrorism, and that while reacting to terror is natural, changing our values in the face of terror is not wise. I believe choice of birth is not the governments but that forcing 1 million poverty level women have unplanned children is not wise fiscally, that making a 10 year old rape victim have the rapists child or forcing a woman to die because of a lack of access to safe treatment while rich folk get it is immoral at this point in time in America that does make me a Bernie Sanders Democrat and unagreeable to most popular republican views Quality handpicked news from over 1000 sources!",57
